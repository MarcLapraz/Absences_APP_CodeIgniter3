# CRUD Absences Application CodeIgniter3
CodeIgniter3 w/Bootstrap + JS (dependant list from DB &amp; more...)

--Interesting things--

front-end :  MVC Pattern & 2 or more dependent Drop-down lists (from database) with Ajax (f. ex -> application/views/fichesView.php)

back-end : All kinds of relationship : One-to-Many, Many-to-Many, One-to-One.

Create the database with the .sql scripts ! 

Configure your database connection in :  application/config/database.php

Enjoy and let me know if it's helpful !
