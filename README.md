CodeIgniter3 w/Bootstrap + JS (dependant list from DB &amp; more...)

--Interesting things--

front-end : 
--- MVC Pattern 
--- 2 or more dependent Drop-down lists (from database) with Ajax (f. ex -> application/views/fichesView.php)

back-end : 
--- One-to-Many Relationship
--- Many-to-Many Relationships

Create the database with the .sql scripts ! 

Configure your database connection in :  application/config/database.php
